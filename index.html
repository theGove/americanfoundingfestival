        The American Founding Festival is the Western United States' premier living history event commemorating the 250th anniversary of the beginning of the American Revolution. This outdoor event is a celebration of the founding of the United States of America, and is free for the public to attend.  We expect in excess of 20,000 attendees over the three days.

            We are currently seeking statements of interest from first-person and third-person historic interpreters in all areas of the American Founding, including military, artisan, and 18th century living.  Some funds to help reimburse travel expenses are available and will be allocated on a case-by-case basis.
