    Fellow Living Historians:
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm emailing you because&nbsp;you expressed interest in participating in the Liberty Village Colonial Festival (LVCF). April 17-19, 2025, Hurricane Utah.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    On Sunday, November 24, at 7:00 MST I'm holding a live Q&amp;A session about how the plans are coming for the festival.&nbsp;The session will be held using Google Meet at the following address:

    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    The meeting will go as long as we have questions, but even if no one joins at first, I'll keep the meeting open until at least 7:30.&nbsp;If you have questions and you are not able to attend at that time, do not hesitate to reach out me by phone, text, or email (801-372-0683).
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    In case you missed my last message, the registration form has been published for participants to submit their information to be considered for the event.&nbsp;Here's the link to sign up.

    Please feel free to share this link with any living historian you think might be interested and invite them to the Q and A too.

    I thought it might be good to have an easy place to look up any past messages (with corrections as needed), so you can see past messages at the following URL:
