      Thanks for expressing interest in the celebration of our nation’s founding to be held in Southern Utah on the 250th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord (April 17-19, 2025). My working title for this festival was the "American Founding Festival" but the sponsor was concerned that the public would not easily visualize what to expect, so the current working title is the "Liberty Village Colonial Festival" (LVCF).&nbsp;We have finalized both the venue and the budget for travel expenses, so we are ready to begin the formal application process.

      In my last communication, I mentioned that we were working with Hurricane City to schedule a park.&nbsp;While we were trying to resolve the city’s concerns about bringing such a large event to a park in a residential area, the County of Washington suggested holding the event as the fairgrounds in conjunction with their county fair, which concludes on April 19.&nbsp;Once I shared the list of 80+ individuals and exhibits that have already expressed interest in participating and shared photos I have from past events, the County Commissioners were extremely positive about the idea.

  <p>
    <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">
      I went to Washington County to walk the fairgrounds to try to envision how this event could work at such a venue.&nbsp;What I found is that there were substantial pros and cons.&nbsp;Here are the two biggest cons:

  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">
      1. I’m not sure there is enough space to accommodate everyone who wants to participate
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">
      2. There is a limited amount of grass

  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">
      I told the commissioners that these concerns might make many folks less eager to participate, especially since it means that some who are camping will be camping on dirt, and exhibits that do not camp onsite (such as the printshop) will need to be set up on pavement.&nbsp;When I expressed that covering travel and lodging expenses would go a long way toward helping participants still feel good about making the trip, they asked me to submit a budget.

      “Thank you” to those individuals who responded to my prior inquiry about travel expenses.&nbsp;Using the data I gathered, I prepared a budget and submitted it to the County.&nbsp;Without disclosing the details, let’s just say that they swallowed hard when they received it.&nbsp;However, they are so excited about kicking off their 15-month celebration of America’s founding with this event, that they approved the budget, which leads me to the pros of this venue:

      1. We have the ability to cover travel and lodging costs broadly.

  <p>
    <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">
      2. We expect in excess of 20,000 attendees during the three days of the festival.

  <p>

      4. There is a large area with bleachers on two sides for musket and artillery demonstrations as well as any military skirmishes
