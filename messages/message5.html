    <h4>Essential Background History – Know the Setting</h4>

    <p>
      At last week's Zoom meeting, Gove provided historical context leading up to the Battles of Lexington and Concord. If you missed it—or want to hear an even richer retelling—this engaging audio covers the critical events, including the Articles of Association.</p>
  <p>
    To enhance the experience, we will provide every exhibit with a broadside printing of the Articles of Association for you to reference and use as you see fit. Here is the audio Link:
