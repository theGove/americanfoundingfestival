          Earlier this week, I was able to make a visit to make a visit to Washington County to visit some of the possible venues for holding the event.&nbsp;As it turns out, this weekend is a very popular weekend to be in Washington County.&nbsp;The two parks with the largest trees are already committed to other events, one hosts a large cars show on our weekend (30,000+ visitors) and another has a farmer's market that cannot be moved.&nbsp;That's the bad news.

          The good news is that the&nbsp;county commissioners are very interested in supporting this event.&nbsp;It happens that the Washington County Fair will run from&nbsp;April 11 through April 19th.&nbsp;The fair will have a strong America 250 theme and the commissioners want to add our event as part of their America 250 kickoff.&nbsp;We've reserved a beautiful new park called&nbsp;

          &nbsp;that is just 2 miles from the&nbsp;County fairgrounds in Hurricane and we'll run a shuttle service between the fair and the park.

          The downside of the venue is that there are no mature trees at this park.&nbsp;However, the weather in Hurricane is beautiful in April (average high of 80 degrees) and the large pond that is directly adjacent to the park will also help moderate the temperature.&nbsp;&nbsp;We still have a few issues to work out with the parks department (e.g. overnight sleeping in the park) but the Mayor of Hurricane is on board with supporting our event, so I think we'll be able to get the needed exceptions.

          So, in short, the park is not ideal (lack of mature trees) but with the county being so supportive and being a part of their America 250 kickoff are big benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;

          I'll provide more information as it comes in and I'll be glad to discuss&nbsp;the venue with you if you like, just give me a call (801-372-1683).
