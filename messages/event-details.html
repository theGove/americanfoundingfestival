  <h2>Lodging</h2>
  <p>
    As we arrange accommodation for your upcoming stay, we want to ensure we’re making the most of the resources available. Onsite camping: A good number of you will be camping onsite. The average temperature in Hurricane in April is a low of 40 to a high of 80 degrees, beautiful camping weather!  Period tents are necessary to camp in the area or there is RV parking with 30 amp hook ups (no water).

  <h2>Restroom and Showers</h2>
  <p>There are many restroom available and two showers.  See <a href="/documents/restroom-map.pdf">restroom map</a> for locations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Showers are located in the building just south of the RV parking. There is a key and a code necessary to obtain entrance.  During festival hours, Holly, in the Colonial Relatives area (space 2 on the location map), will have the keys and will maintain shower schedule to make best use of the two shower stalls. (1 man/ 1 woman). We will coordinate with someone who is camping on site to hold the key after hours.   
  </p>
  <h2>Host Homes</h2>
  <p>
    Many of you have agreed to stay in a host home and placement is currently being arranged.  Holly will let you know in the next few days about your host home locations.   We believe that staying with a host family will be an enriching experience for you and the family and we welcome feedback about your experience. 
</p><p>You will only be placed in a host home of you indicated that as a preference on your registration form.  If you have not heard from Holly about the details of your host home, we were unable to place you with a family and you'll need to make other arrangements.</p>

    We do have funds to help with lodging and travel expenses. These are taxpayer dollars, so we want to treat them judiciously and with respect. Please look at these reimbursement links to familiarize yourself with how you will submit receipts for travel and lodging, they are two separate forms.

    </a>
  </p>
  <p>Please note that we have a cap of $100 per night per hotel room. This anticipates two participants will share a room. If you have a friend or fellow participant you’d like to room with, we encourage you to coordinate with them.  If you have three people in a room $150 would be the reimbursement cap. It breaks down to $50/per person per night. Feel free to secure a short term rental for larger groups.  Please explore other options with Holly before booking a room for a single individual if you are seeking reimbursement.
